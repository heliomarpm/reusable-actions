## ❓ What does this mean?

This project requires that **all changes promoted to production** follow the **Conventional Commits** specification.

Without at least one valid commit, **semantic-release** cannot determine whether the next version should be a:
- patch
- minor
- major

For safety reasons, the release process has been **intentionally blocked**.

---

## ✅ How to fix

Create **at least one commit** following the Conventional Commits format and push it to the repository.

### Required format

### Accepted Types

| chore  | ❌ none        |
| docs   | ❌ none        |

Use commit helpers to enforce the correct format:

- Commitizen
- Husky + commitlint
- Git hook with commit-msg
